# :material-earth: Browser Environment

Browser Environment controls the launch-time hints IntenseRP passes to provider pages.

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Browser & Runtime** -> **Browser Environment**

There are three settings here:

- **Preferred Browser Locale** defaults to **English (en-US)**. It affects browser language signals such as `navigator.language`, request language headers, and locale-sensitive formatting.
- **Browser Timezone** defaults to **System Default**. The built-in override is **New York (`America/New_York`)**.
- **Browser Proxy URL** is optional. It routes provider browser contexts through an HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, or SOCKS5 proxy.

This is best-effort, not a magic cloak. Saved provider preferences, account settings, cookies, local storage, and IP geolocation can still matter.

!!! tip "Recommended default"
    Keep the locale on **English (en-US)** unless you have a specific reason not to. IntenseRP's provider drivers expect English UI text, so this tends to be the most predictable choice.

Timezone is more situational. Leave it on **System Default** unless you specifically need a browser page to report New York time.

## :material-lan-connect: Browser Proxy URL

:material-arrow-right: **Settings** -> **Browser & Runtime** -> **Browser Environment** -> **Browser Proxy URL**

This is a global provider-browser proxy. Leave it blank to connect directly.

Supported examples:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
https://proxy.example:8443
socks4://127.0.0.1:1080
socks5://user:pass@127.0.0.1:1080
```

The scheme (`http`, `https`, `socks4`, or `socks5`) tells Playwright/Patchright which proxy type to use. Username and password can be included in the URL when your proxy requires authentication.

!!! note "Restart required"
    Proxy settings apply when a provider browser context is created. Stop and start the provider browser after changing this.

!!! tip "MiMo-specific proxy"
    Xiaomi MiMo also has its own **Provider Behavior -> Xiaomi MiMo -> Proxy** settings. Use that when only MiMo needs a supported-region proxy and you want other providers to connect normally.
