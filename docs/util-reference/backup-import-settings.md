# :material-backup-restore: Backup & Import Settings

This window is for making a quick `.zip` backup of your current IntenseRP Next v2 config directory, or restoring one later.

![Backup & Import Settings window](../pics/util-reference/backup_import_settings.png)

## :material-cursor-default-click: How to open it

1. Open **Help & Extras**
2. Click **Backup / Import Settings**

---

## :material-folder: What gets backed up

The backup is made from your **active config directory** (shown at the top of the window). By default, it includes everything useful for restoring the app:

- `settings.json.enc` (your encrypted settings)
- `settings.key` (the encryption key for your settings)
- `appflags.json.enc` and other small state files
- `playwright_profiles/` (used for Persistent Sessions)
- `accounts/` (Saved Accounts credentials and usage state)

!!! note "Tip: stop services for a cleaner backup"
    If the browser/services are running, some profile files can be in use. For the most complete backup, click **Stop** in the main window first.

### :material-tune: Customize

Click **Customize** to choose what Backup and Import should use:

- **Settings & State** keeps your settings, app state, small caches, and similar config files.
- **Profiles** keeps browser profile data used by Persistent Sessions.
- **Credentials** keeps Saved Accounts data. Credentials-only backups still include `settings.key` internally so IntenseRP can safely re-encrypt them during import.

All three are enabled by default. Turning off **Profiles** can make a backup/import much faster when you only want to carry settings or accounts to another install.

## :material-archive-arrow-up: Backup to .zip

1. Click **Backup to .zip**
2. Choose where to save the file
3. Done

By default, the file name looks like:

`intenserp-next-config-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.zip`

If some files are locked, the backup can still succeed, but it may warn that it skipped files.

---

## :material-archive-arrow-down: Import from .zip

With all Customize options enabled, Import restores a backup by **replacing the contents** of your active config directory, and then reloading settings automatically.

If you turn some options off, Import only updates the selected parts found in the `.zip` and leaves the rest of your active config directory alone.

1. Click **Import from .zip**
2. Select a backup `.zip`
3. Confirm the warning
4. Wait for the import to finish

!!! warning "Profiles can be locked"
    If **Persistent Sessions** are enabled and the browser/services are running, import can fail because profile files are in use. Stop services first and retry.
